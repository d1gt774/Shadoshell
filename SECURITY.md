At ShadoShell, we take the security of our code, users, and contributors very seriously. We ask that all users and contributors adhere to the following security guidelines and practices to ensure a safe and trusted environment for everyone involved.

Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
If you discover a security vulnerability in ShadoShell, please follow these steps:

Do Not Share Publicly: Please do not disclose security issues publicly (e.g., in GitHub issues, pull requests, etc.). This gives us time to address the issue before it is exploited.

Email the Security Team: Send a private email to xandergonder@outlook.com. This will alert the maintainers to the issue.

Provide Detailed Information: When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following information:

A clear description of the issue.
Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
Any potential impact or exploit scenarios.
Relevant code, configuration, or system details.
If applicable, patches or fixes to mitigate the issue.
Stay Confidential: We appreciate your discretion in keeping security issues private until they have been resolved and a fix has been deployed.

What Happens After Reporting?
Once we receive a vulnerability report:

Acknowledgement: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.

Investigation: Our security team will investigate the issue as quickly as possible.

Fix and Patch: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a patch or solution, and release it to the public as soon as possible.

Public Disclosure: Once a patch is deployed, we will disclose the vulnerability (if applicable) and the steps taken to mitigate it.

Best Practices for Contributors
When contributing to the project, please follow these security practices to help prevent vulnerabilities:

Avoid Hardcoded Credentials: Do not hardcode sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, tokens) in code. Use environment variables or configuration files instead.

Use Secure Coding Practices: Follow secure coding practices for shell scripting, such as:

Avoiding unsafe commands or syntax that could lead to injection attacks.
Sanitizing input properly before using it in commands.
Using secure methods for handling user input or external data.
Use Permissions Properly: Make sure that any files, directories, or services interact with the minimum required permissions to limit potential damage in case of a breach.

Audit and Update Dependencies: Regularly audit the dependencies (if applicable) used in the project to ensure they do not introduce vulnerabilities.

Code Reviews: Ensure that pull requests are thoroughly reviewed for security concerns, especially for code that handles user input or interacts with external systems.

Security Reminders for Users
Stay Up to Date: Always use the latest release of ShadoShell to ensure you have the latest security patches and updates.

Report Suspicious Activity: If you notice any suspicious activity or behavior in ShadoShell or encounter a potential security incident, please report it immediately to xandergonder@outlook.com.

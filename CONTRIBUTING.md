How to Contribute
We encourage contributions in various forms, including bug reports, feature requests, code improvements, documentation updates, and more. Whether you are submitting a simple bug fix or a new feature, please follow these steps to contribute effectively:

1. Report Issues
If you encounter a bug or have an idea for a feature, please follow these steps:

Provide clear information: When reporting an issue, describe the problem or suggestion clearly. Include the following details if applicable:

Contact: Please send any issues or problems to xandergonder@outlook.com.

2. Fork and Clone the Repository
To contribute code, you need to fork the repository and clone your fork to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shadoshell.git
3. Create a New Branch
To ensure your work is organized and easily reversible, create a new branch for each feature or bug fix:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
4. Make Your Changes
Follow coding conventions: Ensure your code follows the project's existing coding style and conventions. This includes consistent indentation, naming conventions, and general readability.
Write tests: If you are adding new features or modifying existing ones, ensure that your changes are covered by tests (if applicable).
Update documentation: If you add new features or commands, make sure to update relevant documentation files (e.g., the README or code comments).
5. Commit Your Changes
Commit your changes with clear, concise commit messages that describe what you've changed and why. Use the following format:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Description of changes made"
If your change addresses an issue, you can reference it by including the issue number in your commit message:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Fix issue #123: Description of the fix"
6. Push Changes to Your Fork
Once you've committed your changes, push them to your fork:

bash
Copy code
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
7. Open a Pull Request
Navigate to the original repository and open a pull request (PR) from your fork's branch to the main branch of the original repository.
Provide a clear description of the changes in the PR. Reference any related issues by including the issue number (e.g., "Fixes #123").
Be open to feedback! The maintainers may ask for revisions or clarification before merging your PR.
Code Style Guidelines
Please follow these general guidelines when writing code for ShadoShell:

Bash scripting best practices: Ensure that your Bash scripts are optimized for readability, maintainability, and efficiency.
Avoid complex one-liners: Try to break down complex commands into more understandable, multi-line solutions.
Comments: Include comments where necessary, especially for non-obvious code blocks, to explain the logic.
Whitespace: Use consistent indentation with 2 spaces per indentation level. Do not use tabs.
Testing
If your change introduces new functionality, please ensure the following:

Test scripts: If you add or modify a command, ensure that it works as expected in the ShadoShell environment.
Compatibility: Ensure that your change is compatible with both the ShadoShell environment and other systems it may interact with (if applicable).
Documentation
Keep the documentation up to date:

Commands: If you add a new command, update the README.md and any associated documentation to reflect this addition.
Code comments: Provide clear comments explaining the function and purpose of complex code blocks.
Examples: Include practical usage examples for any new commands or features added.
Reviewing Pull Requests
If you are reviewing a pull request:

Check for functionality: Ensure that the changes work as expected without breaking any existing functionality.
Check for style: Verify that the code follows the style guidelines listed above.
Test thoroughly: Run the modified or new commands to ensure they perform as expected.
Provide constructive feedback: Offer suggestions or request changes in a respectful and helpful manner.
